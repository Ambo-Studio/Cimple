               IMPORTANT NOTICE:

               THIS VERSION OF THE TACALY END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON September 11, 2018.

               YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT (THE “AGREEMENT”) BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING TACALY’S ONLINE PLATFORM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE PLATFORM.

               Thank you for your interest in Tacaly’s online gaming services and interactive games, and the interactive games from other developers (“Licensors”) who make their games available through Tacaly’s Platform. (Tacaly’s and the Licensors’ games are collectively referred to herein as the “Games”). This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which you are licensed to install and use the Platform. As used herein, the term “Platform” refers collectively, and at times individually, to (1) the Tacaly App software, (2) the Tacaly tacaly.com gaming services, (3) each of the Games, (4) authorized Mobile Apps relating to the Games and the Tacaly service, and (5) all features and components of each of them, whether installed or used on a computer or mobile device.

               Except as otherwise provided below, if you reside within a member state of the European Union and are accessing the Platform on a personal computer, use of the Platform is licensed to you by Tacaly S.A.S., a French company having its registered office at 145 rue Yves Le Coz, 78000 Versailles, France. In all other circumstances, use of the Platform is licensed to you by Tacaly International B.V., Stroombaan 16, 1181 VX Amstelveen, the Netherlands (Tacaly SAS, and Activision Tacaly International B.V. are referred to herein as “Tacaly”, “we,” or “us”).

                   The Platform.
                       The Tacaly Account. To use the Platform, you must register, or have previously registered, a Tacaly account (an “Account”). Creation and use of Accounts are subject to the following terms and conditions:
                           You may establish an Account only if: (i) you are a “natural person” and an adult in your country of residence (Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, partnerships and other legal or business entities may not establish an Account); and (ii) you are not an individual specifically prohibited by Tacaly from using the Platform.
                           When you create or update an Account, you must:
                               provide Tacaly with accurate and up to date information that is personal to you, such as, but not limited to, your name and email address. Additionally, in order to play certain Games or use certain features offered on the Platform, you may also be required to provide Tacaly with payment information (such as credit card information). Tacaly’s retention and/or use of your personal information is subject to Tacaly’s Privacy Policy, located at http://eu.Tacaly.com/en-gb/company/about/privacy.html. Tacaly shall also have the right to obtain non-personal data from your connection to the Platform; and
                               select a unique username and password (collectively referred to hereunder as “Login Information”). You may not use your real name as the password for the Account, and you cannot share the Account or the Login Information with anyone, unless the terms of this Agreement allow it.
                           To play Games on the Platform, you will need to add a Game license to an Account, which requires an authentication code generated by Tacaly. For Game licenses purchased at retail, the authentication code will either be included in the packaging materials or sent to you via electronic means. If you purchase a Game digitally from Tacaly, the authentication code will be assigned to the Account when you purchase the Game.
                           Please take a few moments to review Tacaly’s Account Security information available here: https://eu.Tacaly.com/support/en/article/14319. You must maintain the confidentiality of the Login Information, as you are responsible for all uses of the Login Information and the Account, including purchases, whether or not authorized by you. If you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of the Login Information, you must immediately notify Tacaly at http://support.Tacaly.com/en-gb. Tacaly, in its sole discretion, may require additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim, and once Tacaly has the information that Tacaly deems necessary to verify your claim, Tacaly will take actions to freeze your Account until Tacaly has returned control of your Account to you. Regardless of any actions Tacaly may take on your behalf, you acknowledge and agree that Tacaly has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid and, if so, the appropriate remedy.
                           Subject to the laws of your country of residence, minor children may utilize an Account established by their parent or legal guardian. In the event that you permit your minor child or legal ward (collectively, your “Child”) to use an Account on the Platform, you hereby agree to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and your Child, and you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all uses of the Account by your Child whether or not such uses were authorized by you.
                           Your use of the Platform to interact with Tacaly and other players is governed by Tacaly’s Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) and applicable in-game policies (the “In-game Policies”). The Code of Conduct and In-Game Policies are not meant to be exhaustive. The Code of Conduct and In-Game Policies are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference, and are available on Tacaly’s Customer Support database, located at: https://eu.Tacaly.com/support/en/
                       Grant of License. If you accept and comply with the terms of this Agreement, Tacaly will grant, and you will receive, a limited non-sub licensable, and non-exclusive license to use the Platform subject to the “License Limitations,” set forth in Section 1.C below, as follows:
                           You may install applicable components or features of the Platform (including the Games) on one or more computers or mobile devices under your legitimate control.
                           You may use the Platform for your personal and non-commercial entertainment purposes only, unless specifically allowed under the terms of this Agreement.
                           You may not transfer your rights and obligations to use the Platform.
                           Some of the Games may be subject to specific license terms that may include the following:
                               Trial or “Starter” versions of Games allow you to play a limited version of the Game before you will be required to purchase a Game license. Licenses to use the full version of these Games can be purchased through the Platform.
                               In certain cases, the “full version,” of Games can only be played after you purchase and add a Game license to your Account.
                               You may play the Game(s) for you obtained a license for at authorized publicly-available cyber cafés or computer gaming centers on the Platform through an Account registered to you. You will be informed of any requirement to purchase a license before you can use a Game, and of any time limitations that would affect how long you can play a Game.
                               Certain Games may be obtained through the Platform, but may not be playable on the Platform. In such an event, the Game will be provided with a separate End User License Agreement that will govern your installation and use of the Game post purchase.
                               Games which are produced by Tacaly’s Licensors and distributed through, and/or played upon, the Platform will require that you agree to the Licensor’s End User License Agreement prior to your being able to play the Game on the Platform, and the terms and conditions of Licensor’s End User License Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and a Licensor’s End User License Agreement pertaining to the use of the Licensor’s Game, the Licensor’s End User License Agreement shall supersede and govern your use of the Licensor’s Game. However, in the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Licensor’s End User License Agreement pertaining to any other aspect of the Platform, this Agreement shall supersede and govern your use of the Platform.

                   Limitations of Liability.

                   Equitable Remedies. You hereby agree that Tacaly would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically followed and enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of the Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.
                   Alterations. Tacaly may, from time to time, change or modify this Agreement as its business and the law evolves. In this case, Tacaly will notify you of any such changes or modifications by providing special notice. If you do not object to the amended Agreement within six (6) weeks following the special notice, your continued use of the Platform will mean that you accept the amended Agreement. With the special notice, Tacaly will remind you that your continued use after the expiration of six (6) weeks following the special notice means that you accept any and all changes. Those changes or modifications will not affect essential characteristics of the Platform. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact Tacaly Customer Service.
